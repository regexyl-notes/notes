- If the problem is about X, think of Y.
	- Choosing the smallest or largest among a group of numbers --> #heap
	- Directed graph with edges (e.g. Course Schedule) --> Topological sorting (i.e. Kahn's algorithm - start with the nodes that have no incoming edges, DFS - DFS search on each node in arbitrary order)
	- [[Kadane's Algorithm]]
- Python-related notes
	- Addition and subtraction take higher precedence to bitwise left and right shifts. (refer to this page [for full table](https://www.scaler.com/topics/operator-precedence-in-python/)), e.g. `1 << numOfKeys - 1` is different from `(1 << numOfKeys) - 1`
