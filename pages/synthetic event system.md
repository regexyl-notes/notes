- Event handlers are passed instances of `SyntheticEvent`, a cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event.
- `SyntheticEvent` has the same interface as the browser's native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`.
- The synthetic events may not directly map to the browser's native events.
- E.g. React's `onMouseLeave` points to a native `mouseout` event (which can be seen if you access `event.nativeEvent`).
- Why is this implemented?
	- Provides consistency by normalizing events across browsers and systems so that they have the same properties.
