		- Review: I didn't think of the backtracking solution not the BFS solution, though both are incredibly identical to what I'd written - and it passed the test
		- The time complexity for this problem is `O(M ** N * N)`, where M is the maximum length of the string a number can be mapped to, while N is the length of the input string. In the backtracking problem, we're required to explore M pathways for every character of the input. There is a for loop in each backtracking iteration, hence the `* N`.

	- Look at 10 questions I've done in the past week -> mentally write down the pseudocode for these questions -> write down edge cases for that problem -> check if it matches the best solution
	- Categorize the questions done today into topics - evaluate how I did for each of them - think of why I did not intuitively think of the solution for those that I did not do well in
