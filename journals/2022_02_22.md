- React
	- Fragments
collapsed:: true
		- Allows a component to return a list of children without being wrapped in an extra element, usually a `div` or `span`. [^a]
		- ```js
		  const Fragment = React.Fragment;
		  
		  <Fragment>
		    <ChildA />
		    <ChildB />
		    <ChildC />
		  </Fragment>
		  ```

	- Key prop
		- When React re-renders components and the same element types are returned, it keeps those components/DOM nodes, even if all the props have changed. This is different if the component has a `key` prop.
		- You can reinitialize a component (with all state removed and reset) by attaching a key prop to that same component.
		- View [example](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-key-props-2zk79f) of a `key` + `useReducer` solution to reset a counter.
	- Web worker
		- When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.
		- A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs a thread in the background.
		- https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webworkers.asp
		- Example of using a web worker: Using WebAssembly in a web worker to run the **esbuild** API in the browser
	- `EventTarget.addEventListener()` - option: `{ capture: true }`
		- If not specified, it defaults to false.
		- A `true` value indicates that events of this type will be dispatched to the registered listener before being dispatched to any EventTarget beneath it in the DOM tree.
