		- The making of a Wordle
		- HTML + CSS + JS
		- Add in framework - React (all client-side)
		- Want to add in messages from WhatsApp to process files on server (requires Node)
		- Introduce CRA (with fast-refresh)
		- Now that there's server, we can use bundlers + transpilers (as loaders in the webpack bundler)
		- Bonus: linting + prettier
		- Dev Tools - memory usage on Chrome Tools
	- TODO Build 2 versions of a React boilerplate (one with good ol webpack, the other with a cobbled-together esbuild - or with other bundlers - or vite)
- git checkout main && git log --reverse
	- ```
	  ```
