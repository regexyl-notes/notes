- Notes
	- Basics of a compiler
	  collapsed:: true
		- Has 3 primary stages: Parsing, Transformation and Code Generation
			- *Parsing*: The taking of raw code and turning it into a more abstract representation of the code. It has 2 sub-stages to it:
				- Lexical analysis: aka Tokenization
				- Syntactic analysis: The formation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the above tokens.
			- *Transformation*: Taking the abstract representation and manipulating to do whatever the compiler wants it to.
			- *Code Generation*: Takes the transformed representation and turns it into new code.
	- [[Babel]]
		-
	- Barebones React application
		- Types
			- Pure JS (no need to consider; most people use JSX directly)
			- JSX (w/ ESM)
				- Babel
			- TSX (w/ ESM)
				- tsconfig.json + Babel
			- TSX (w/ ESM + webpack)
				- tsconfig.json + Babel + webpack.config.js
		- Is it right to say that a a TSX project with ESM and Webpack flows like this:
			- TypeScript is converted to JavaScript via `tsc` (i.e. the TS compiler), while the component code in the angle brackets remain the same (i.e. the TSX components, albeit possibly being known as JSX components once they are transpiled to a JS file).
				- Uses `tsconfig.json`
				- ==‼️== Babel can strip out type annotations: {{embed ((621b1ec2-662a-4c0c-be0a-c2a71365b240)) }}
			- JSX is then converted to JS via Babel. ==The transformation of JS-based code should end here.==
				- Uses `.babelrc.js`?
			- Webpack steps in to bundle the app into one or more bundles.
				- It can also:
					- Process file types that are not .js or .json and convert them into valid modules (e.g. css) - **Loader**
						- Example of Loaders
							- [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader): Compiles Sass to CSS
							- [expose-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/expose-loader): Allows to expose a module (in whole or part) to a global object (`self`, `window`, `global`)
					- Transform certain type of modules using a wider range of tasks (e.g. bundle optimization, asset management, injection of environmental variables) - **Plugin**
						- Examples of Plugins
							- Under [webpack-contrib](https://github.com/webpack-contrib)
								- [compression-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/compression-webpack-plugin): Prepare compressed versions of assets to serve them with [[Content-Encoding]]
								- [eslint-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/eslint-webpack-plugin): A ESLint plugin for webpack to find and fix problems in JS code.
								- [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin): Extracts CSS into separate files by creating a CSS file per JS file which contains CSS. Supports on-demand-loading of CSS and sourcemaps.
								- [copy-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin#copy-webpack-plugin): Copies individual files or entire directories, which already exist, to the build directory.
								-
							- 3rd Party
								- [prerender-spa-plugin](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/prerender-spa-plugin): Prerenders static HTML in a single-page application
